Hello, I’m Mel! With over 7 years of experience in cybersecurity, I’ve worked as a researcher, scientist, developer, and engineer at Sandia National Labs. My focus includes _fuzzing techniques_, _CI/CD pipelines_, and developing cutting-edge security solutions. I’m passionate about creative problem-solving and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of cybersecurity.

If you need to get in touch, feel free to contact me via _[email](mailto:contact@melisasavich.com)_ or _[LinkedIn]()_. I’m also open to collaborating on research projects—if you have an idea, let’s chat!
